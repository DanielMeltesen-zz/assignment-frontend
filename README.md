# assignment-frontend
The assignment set by Our Labor Is Joy, have been solved.

## Static HTML
The simple CV Widget have been made with static HTML within the /html/ folder.
I've only used test content.

## AngularJS
My first encounter with AngularJs, so be gentle. One thing I would've liked to figure out is someway of looping through .list looking at an array for year, and then splitting by encounter.
But hey this is what you get.

## Where to find the assignment ?
I've created a small site at http://ourlaborisjoy.danielmeltesen.dk, where you can see the assignment live.

## Where to find more about me ?
Go visit www.DanielMeltesen.dk

## CV ?
Can be in /assets/pdf/xyz or as a link at the sites.
